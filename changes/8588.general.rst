Created two functions to workaround the memory increase due to datamodel.open. The new functions in the basic_utils script are use_datamodels and copy_datamodel. The first function determines if it is necessary to open a datamodel and returns it or simply returns the datamodel given as input. The second function makes a copy of the datamodel depending on whether the step is being run as part of a pipeline or not. Both functions are now called in all steps of the Detector1 pipeline.
